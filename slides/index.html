		<h2>What is Open-Source Software?</h2>
		<p>Open-source software is software whose source code is available for anyone to view, modify, and enhance. Source code refers to computer instructions that are written by software developers in a programming language to manipulate the way software works.</p>

	<section class="slide">
		<h2>Open-Source vs Free vs Proprietary Software</h2>
		<p>Open-source and free software have their similarities, and these similarities often lead to an improper assumption that these two entities are synonymous.
Proprietary software is vastly different since it is often owned with restrictions.

		<h2>What is Free Software?</h2>
			<blockquote><p>Free software is software that gives you the user the freedom to share, study and modify it. We call this free software because the user is free.</p></blockquote>

		<h2>What is Free Software?</h2>


			<blockquote><p>Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer.</p></blockquote>

		<h2 class="shrink">A program is free software if the program's users have these four essential freedoms, according to Richard Stallman, a founder of the movement:</h2>
	</section>



	<section class="slide">
		<h2>Four Essential Freedoms of Free Software</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
			<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
			<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).</li>
			<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
		</ol>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<h2>What is Proprietary Software?</h2>
		<p><b>Proprietary software</b> has restrictions, as it is typically software that is owned by the person or business that created it.</p>
		<p>It is not uncommon to find that the source code for proprietary software to be closely guarded and secret. Without doing so, users could study and modify the executable files, threatening the profitability of the software and the viability of its creator.</p>
	</section>


		<section class="slide">
			<h2>What is a GPL License</h2>
			<p>The GPL (General Public License) was created by Richard Stallman in 1989 and is the founding license for open-source software. Its goal is to protect four fundamental freedoms that are considered the underpinnings of  free software.</p>

		<section class="slide">
			<h2>Open-source Software and YOU: the Benefits</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>WordPress as an open-source framework allows developers all over the world access and improve its code.</li>
		<li>Improvements to WordPress also comes in the form of plugins, add-ons, and themes.</li>
		<li>The WordPress community is able to grow, share, and collectively server as the backbone of living software.</li>
	</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="slide">
			<h2>Ways you can contribute to the WordPress project</h2>
			<p>WordPress is maintained and advanced by a global community of volunteer contributors. WordPress needs more than software developers. All potential contributors have unique skill sets that help with:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Assisting in support forums</li>
		<li>Writing documentation</li>
		<li>Translating text</li>
		<li>Helping with Meetups or WordCamps</li>
